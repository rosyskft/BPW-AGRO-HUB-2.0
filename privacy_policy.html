2., Data processing principles in website operation 
 
Personal data may be processed under the following circumstances: 
a) when the data subject has given his consent, or 
b) when processing is necessary as decreed by law or by a local authority based on authorization 
conferred by law concerning specific data defined therein for the performance of a task carried out in 
the public interest (hereinafter referred to as ‘mandatory processing’). 
Personal data may be processed also if obtaining the data subject’s consent is impossible or it would 
give rise to disproportionate costs, and the processing of personal data is necessary for compliance 
with a legal obligation pertaining to the data controller, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests 
pursued by the controller or by a third party, and enforcing these interests is considered 
proportionate to the limitation of the right for the protection of personal data. 
Where personal data is recorded under the data subject’s consent, the controller shall - unless 
otherwise provided for by law - be able to process the data recorded where this is necessary: 
a) for compliance with a legal obligation pertaining to the controller, or 
b) for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, if enforcing 
these interests is considered proportionate to the limitation of the right for the protection of personal 
data, without the data subject’s further consent, or after the data subject having withdrawn his 
consent 
Personal data may be processed only for specified and explicit purposes, where it is necessary for the 
exercising of certain rights and fulfilment of obligations. The purpose of processing must be satisfied 
in all stages of data processing operations; recording of personal data shall be done under the 
principle of lawfulness. 
The personal data processed must be essential for the purpose for which it was recorded, and it must 
be suitable to achieve that purpose. Personal data may be processed to the extent and for the 
duration necessary to achieve its purpose. 
Personal data may be processed only if the data subject signifies his/her agreement after obtaining 
proper information. 
Prior to data processing being initiated the data subject shall be informed whether his consent is 
required or processing is mandatory. Before processing operations are carried out the data subject 
shall be clearly and elaborately informed of all aspects concerning the processing of his personal 
data, such as the purpose for which his data is required and the legal basis, the person entitled to 
control the data and to carry out the processing, the duration of the proposed processing operation, 
whether personal data is recorded under the data subject’s consent, for compliance with a legal 
obligation pertaining to the controller, or for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by a third 
party, and the persons to whom his data may be disclosed. Information shall also be provided on the 
data subject’s rights and remedies 

The accuracy and completeness, and the up-to-dateness of the data must be provided for throughout 
the processing operation, and shall be kept in a way to permit identification of the data subject for no 
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were recorded. 
Personal data may be transmitted to a data controller or processor operating in a third country, if the 
data subject has given his explicit consent, or the conditions laid down in Article 5 and 6 of the 
Privacy Act for data processing are satisfied and - save where Article 6(2) applies – the adequate level 
of protection of the personal data have been ensured in the third country during the course of the 
control and processing of the data transferred. Transfer of data to EEA Member States shall be 
considered as if the transmission took place within the territory of Hungary
